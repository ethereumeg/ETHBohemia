### Abstract

## 1. Hackathon

ETHBohemia is envisioned as a dynamic, multi-day platform that brings together a diverse array of individuals, from event organizers and open-source tool developers to community advocates and creative visionaries. Our collective aim is to transcend conventional boundaries by focusing on enhancing inclusivity, fostering diversity, and promoting open engagement. We're also deeply committed to laying the groundwork for next-generation self-hosted tools that will streamline the planning process and make organizing events more enjoyable. As we innovate, we'll engage in substantive dialogues to distinguish our non-profit efforts from commercial endeavors, always staying true to our core values and principles. The outcome is a rich exchange of insights that promises to elevate both our individual and collective endeavors within the community.

Our expansive lens extends beyond the realm of simple gatherings, encompassing the entire event lifecycleâ€”from intimate meetups to large-scale conferences, and from online to offline hackathons. We delve into the nuances of event planning, execution, and follow-up with a keen eye for innovation. This includes exploring state-of-the-art solutions for event data structuring, Ethereum ecosystem cataloging, and the latest in ticketing, video streaming, and hackathon platforms. However, our explorations aren't limited to just the technical aspects; we also tackle the more complex issues such as financing models, self-regulation, and attendee privacy. The ultimate goal is to arrive at actionable, holistic solutions that meet the needs of both organizers and participants, thereby revolutionizing the way events are conceptualized, organized, and enjoyed.

To make this experience as inclusive as possible, we anticipate hosting around 50 in-person hackathon participants, supplemented by options for live streaming and online participation. Upholding a respectful and inclusive environment is paramount, which is why adherence to our event's Code of Conduct is non-negotiable for all attendees. By doing so, we ensure that ETHBohemia is not just an event, but a transformative experience that shapes the future of community engagement and event organization.

ETHBohemia is a donation-backed non-profit event. Therefore, there will be no sponsors.
